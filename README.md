## More detailed explanation of rules


# There are two types of cards in this game:

* Action cards allow you to do actions during the game, such as taking cards from your opponents or skipping your turn. See them explained in more detail below.
* Value cards: Bitcoin, Monero, Ether, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin. And also Bitconnect. :)
* You collect them during the game but are essential after the game when you need to calculate the result and declare a winner.
* One of the value cards (Bitconnect) does not give you any value, but it instead reduces your portfolio by half.
* There are three value cards of each kind, but only one Bitconnect card.

# Action cards in more detail

* Hacker card: This card allows you to take one card from one of your opponents (you choose which one). The opponent does not have to show you (the front of) her or his cards, so you have to take a blind guess which card to take.

* ICO card: You choose one of your opponents to give you one of her/his value cards. The opponent decides herself/himself which card to give you. Important: The opponent CAN give you the Bitconnect card. If the opponent does not have any value card in their hand, your action card has been spent for nothing. Optional rule: If opponent says s/he doesn't have any value card, you can demand that s/he shows you her/his cards in order to prove they're right. Important: only play this rule if players don't trust each other. Otherwise you shouldn't use it.

* Futures card: This card allows you to secretly take a look of the next three cards in the draw pile (but make sure you don’t change their order!).

* SEC card: This card prevents one of your opponents to take a turn. You can play this card at any time you want (except when it's your turn). You play it just before the "victim’s" turn. When the card is played, the poor opponent cannot take any action (except the STOP card) and cannot take a card from the draw pile.

* STOP card: This card stops any action from another player (except the Bitconnect-free action). You can also put a stop to a stop, which invalidates the previous stop card.

* Bitconnect-free card: This card helps you get rid of the Bitconnect card you hold. No one can play a STOP card on the Bitconnect-free card. When you play this card, you can put the Bitconnect card back anywhere in the draw pile. You can put it back secretly so that no one else sees where you put it.After you played this card, you can, of course, take a new card from the draw pile when you end your turn.

* Skip card: This card helps you skip your turn, which means you don’t have to draw a card from the draw pile. But you can play some actions before you play this card.

* Shuffle card: This card allows you to shuffle the whole draw pile. Important: Another player can demand to also shuffle the deck themselves, if they think your shuffling was inappropriate.

* Airdrop card: This card enables you to take one more card from the draw pile (besides the one at the end of your turn). So instead of taking one card, you end up taking two.

# Gameplay
## The gameplay goes like this:

* Cards are properly shuffled, and each of the players receives three (3) cards in the beginning. The rest is put in the pile in the middle of the desk.
* Players decide who will start. It can be some weird reason, such as: "the last person who invested in a crypto scam" or "the person who made the biggest single loss in crypto" or whatever.
* The person who starts can play an action (or many actions one-by-one, or none at all) and picks a card when their turn ends (unless they decide to skip). Important: Your turn ends when you pick a card from the pile. If you want to play an action card, you have to do it when it’s your turn, but before you pick a card from the pile (except the SEC and * STOP cards - you can play them at any time you want).
* You can play many action cards in a single turn (or none at all). As mentioned, your turn ends when you take a card from the draw pile.
* When the draw pile is emptied, the game continues as long as players can (or want to) play their action cards.
* If a player manages to get rid of the Bitconnect card AFTER the draw pile is emptied, the Bitconnect card is discarded to the discard pile (and thus effectively removed from the game).


## WINNER: When the game ends, everyone calculates the current market value of their value cards. Whoever has the biggest portfolio, wins. Use this calculator to quickly determine the winner.
